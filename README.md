## Purpose
  This project is a web app that simulates a store for musical instruments. Users can create an account, add products into the cart, view the order and administrators can add products directly from the website, edit products, delete products. The purpose of the app is academic.

## Technologies
  For the backend, we used:
   - C# for writing the code;
   - SQL Server for the database.
  We used a "code first" model, where we firstly created the tables on paper, them made all the Models, Controllers, DTOs, Repositories and the migrated all into a database.
  For the frontend, we used angular, with CSS, HTML, TypeScript to create the pages. The frontend is located in another repository, called "MusicForALLfrontend".
